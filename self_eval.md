# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
# I feel comfortable creating my own methods now, I have always relied on built in methods. The problems really pushed me to make sure I felt comfortable with working with my own methods and by the end I think I was able to help Gabe.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
# Methods allow us to shrink down the amount of code for each class of objects we need to work with. Which helps us keep our code contained and neat without having to repeat ourselves as much.
